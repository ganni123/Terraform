In Terraform, .tfvars files (typically with a .tfvars extension) are used to set specific values for input variables defined in your Terraform configuration.

They allow you to separate configuration values from your Terraform code, making it easier to manage different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or to store sensitive information without exposing it in your code.
